# Microture

Minimal application framework with maximum flexibility

1) ObjectFactory using "locate" to subclass classes for version or subtypes
2) Aspects to enforce security on selected methods 
3) Rule engine to subclass workflow
4) Attributes Table model to subclass the data behind the classes
5) Velocity templates to generate cloud formation template to support multiple tiers
